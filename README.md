# Magic

``Magic`` is a general-purpose tool that subtracts the sky background from dithered MIRI images that contain only point sources.
This tool should be run on ``jwst`` Stage 2 data products, followed by the provided wrapper for ``jwst`` Stage 3.
The only file that needs to be modified and then executed is ``make_magic.py``.
